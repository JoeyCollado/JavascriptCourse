//constructor property = every object in the javascript has a constructor
//                       used to construct an object
//                       always called implicitly
//                       instantiate = is what is called whenever we create object

/*
const person = {
    name: "joey"
};

console.log(person.constructor)
*/

//both are the same but with diff syntax
//let newObj = {};
//let newObj = new Object();

/*
//instead of writing
new String();
new Boolean();
new Number();
//we use literal
'Joey'
true, false
1,2,3,4,5
